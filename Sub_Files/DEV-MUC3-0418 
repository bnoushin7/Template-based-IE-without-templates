[TEXT] MEDELLIN -- AN BOMBING ATTACK ATTACK ON 3 AUGUST OCCURRED AT A BRANCH OF BANCO POPULAR, AT THE INTERSECTION OF 49TH AVENUE AND 50TH STREET, ITAGUI MUNICIPALITY, TO THE SOUTH OF ABURRA VALLEY. FIVE INDIVIDUALS WERE INJURED, AND SEVERE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE OCCURRED. THE INJURED WERE 19-YEAR-OLD ROBINSON RAMIREZ, 30-YEAR-OLD ROBERTO ARCESIO PABON, AND 40-YEAR-OLD HUGO MORALES, AND TWO OTHER UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TREATED AT ITAGUI'S SAN RAFAEL HOSPITAL AND OTHER HOSPITALS IN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT'S CAPITAL. AN OFFICIAL REPORT STATES THAT THE BLAST COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE BANK FACILITIES AND CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO NEARBY BUSINESSES AND SEVERAL AREA RESIDENCES. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THIS NEW ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE 5TH DAY OF A CURFEW, WHICH WAS ORDERED ON 30 AUGUST BY THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT. IN ORDERING A CURFEW, THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF MEDELLIN MAYOR JUAN GOMEZ MARTINEZ.

[TEXT] WHAT BEGAN AS A SEARCH FOR A WEAPONS CACHE BECAME A MYSTERY THAT WOULD RIVAL ANY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' STORIES. IN A HOUSE LOCATED 1 KM FROM TENJO, NORTH OF BOGOTA, 13TH BRIGADE MEMBERS TODAY FOUND A GRAVE CONTAINING THE BODIES OF TWO WOMEN WHO WERE BURIED MORE THAN 3 MONTHS AGO. THE HOUSE WAS RENTED IN 1987 BY LUIS EMILIO ESPINA, ALSO KNOWN AS GONZALO ROJAS, WHO WAS KILLED 1 WEEK AGO. SOURCES IN THE 13TH BRIGADE LINK HIM AND HIS LOAN GUARANTOR, ERNESTO VELEZ, WHO WAS KILLED ON THE GUAYMARAL HIGHWAY 6 WEEKS AGO, TO THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. THE HOUSE IS ON THE PERU FARM, WHICH ADJOINS THE CHIGUACHI ESTATE BELONGING TO GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND CAMILO ZAPATA, WHO ALSO OWNS THE FAMOUS MARROQUIN CASTLE. ACCORDING TO A HIGH-RANKING INFANTRY SCHOOL OFFICER, THIS IS THE SAME HOUSE WHERE [BOGOTA MAYOR] ANDRES PASTRANA WAS HELD WHEN HE WAS KIDNAPPED. THE PERSON LEASING THE PROPERTY DISAPPEARED AFTER THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN, AND SINCE THEN 10 OTHER PEOPLE WHO USED TO FREQUENT THE FARM HAVE BEEN MYSTERIOUSLY KILLED.

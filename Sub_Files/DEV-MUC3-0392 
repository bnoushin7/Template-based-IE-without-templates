[TEXT] COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO SAID IN A MESSAGE "TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY," WHICH WAS ISSUED THIS EVENING BY THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC, THAT "THE SURVIVAL OF COLOMBIA, ONE OF THE MOST STABLE AND OLDEST DEMOCRACIES IN LATIN AMERICA, IS IN DANGER." THE COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT CATEGORICALLY STATED: "WE CANNOT REST UNTIL WE HAVE DESTROYED THE DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS. WE HAVE CAPTURED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND CONFISCATED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROPERTIES AND AIRCRAFT, AND WE WILL STEADFASTLY PURSUE THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS DESPITE THEIR RESOURCES AND MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS." THE PRESIDENCY SAID THAT BARCO'S MESSAGE WAS ALSO BROADCAST BY THE MOST IMPORTANT TELEVISION NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES. DRUG TRAFFICKERS "MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE INTERNATIONAL FUGITIVES RUNNING FROM A CIVILIZED SOCIETY," BARCO SAID IN HIS MESSAGE. THE PRESIDENT ADDED THAT "THERE MUST BE NO RESPITE OR HOME FOR THEM" AND THAT "THERE MUST BE NO MARKET FOR THEIR DRUGS." BARCO'S DRAMATIC MESSAGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS BROADCAST SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS LEARNED THAT FABIO OCHOA RESTREPO, FATHER OF JORGE LUIS, FABIO, AND DAVID OCHOA VASQUEZ -- WHOSE EXTRADITION HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE U.S. AUTHORITIES -- SENT A PUBLIC LETTER TO BARCO PROPOSING THAT THEY START "WITH A CLEAN SLATE." BARCO ADDED THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT JUST STRUGGLING AGAINST COLOMBIA, BECAUSE "THE WHOLE WORLD IS UNITED IN ITS INDIGNATION AND IN ITS SOLIDARITY WITH THE ACTIONS WE ARE CURRENTLY CARRYING OUT." VIRGILIO BARCO SAID DRUG TRAFFICKING IS "A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE THAT IS BEING NURTURED BY THE HABITS OF MILLIONS OF COCAINE CONSUMERS, SOME OF WHOM ARE PROBABLY LISTENING." "THOSE WHO DEPEND ON COCAINE HAVE PERMITTED THE APPEARANCE OF THE MOST VIOLENT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT THE WORLD HAS KNOWN," THE PRESIDENT STATED. "WHAT INITIALLY SEEMED A MATTER OF PERSONAL HABITS HAS HAD EXPLOSIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIETY," HE ADDED. BARCO WARNED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: "NATURALLY, IT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO REDUCE THE DEMAND THAN FOR US TO REDUCE THE OFFER. WE CANNOT FULLY DESTROY DRUG TRAFFICKING WHILE IT IS CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING EXTRAORDINARY PROFITS AND WHILE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO CONSUME ILLEGAL DRUGS SOMEWHERE, IN SOME COUNTRY." THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BEGAN AN ALL-OUT WAR AGAINST THE DRUG CARTELS 10 DAYS AGO, FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR AND LIBERAL PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN ON 18 AUGUST.

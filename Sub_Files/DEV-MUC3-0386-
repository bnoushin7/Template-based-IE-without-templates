[TEXT] THE KIDNAPPING OF FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND THE MURDER OF A PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN IN GUATEMALA CITY THIS WEEK SHOOK THE COUNTRY AND UNLEASHED A WAVE OF CRITICISM AGAINST THE VINICIO CEREZO ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE OF WHAT CRITICS CALLED "ITS INABILITY TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO CITIZENS." SOME OF THE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES TODAY WERE: "RAMIRO CASTILLO'S MURDER CONDEMNED," "CRIME AGAINST BUSINESSMAN CAUSES GENERAL INDIGNATION," "DEPUTIES ASK FOR END TO VIOLENCE," "THE BLOODBATH MUST STOP," AND "CALL FOR GOVERNMENT MINISTER'S RESIGNATION." THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO DISAPPEARED THIS WEEK ARE VICTOR HUGO RODRIGUEZ JARAMILLO, HIS WIFE, SILVIA MARIA AZURDIA UTRERA, IVAN ERNESTO GONZALEZ FUENTES, CARLOS CONDE, AND HUGO GRAMAJO. THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE, WHICH EMERGED FROM THE ESQUIPULAS PEACE AGREEMENT, EXPRESSED ITS CONCERN TODAY OVER THE LATEST VIOLENCE WHICH, IT SAID, IS EVIDENCE OF THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY. THE COMMITTEE ASKED THAT THE LIVES OF THE KIDNAP VICTIMS BE RESPECTED AND IT ADDED THAT SOME OF THEM WERE "ARRESTED BY THE SECURITY FORCES IN THE CAPITAL AND THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR." RAMIRO CASTILLO, THE PRESIDENT OF THE BANCO INDUSTRIAL AND ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT GUATEMALAN BUSINESSMEN, WAS SHOT TO DEATH ON 24 AUGUST BY A GROUP OF ARMED MEN WHO ENTERED HIS HOUSE IN SANTA CATARIAN PINULA, 30 KM SOUTHWEST OF THE CAPITAL. THE AUTHORITIES SAID HE WAS KILLED WHEN HE TRIED TO PREVENT A THEFT FROM OCCURRING IN HIS HOUSE BUT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE FAMILY RULED OUT THAT POSSIBILITY. ONE OF CASTILLO'S CHILDREN, 23-YEAR-OLD RAMIRO, WAS ALSO WOUNDED IN THE INCIDENT. CASTILLO'S MURDER CAUSED ANGER, ESPECIALLY IN THE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SECTOR. THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF FARMING, COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND FINANCIAL ASSOCIATIONS (CACIF), WHICH HOUSES THE PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS, BLAMED THE CEREZO ADMINISTRATION AND ESPECIALLY THE SECURITY FORCES "FOR THEIR INABILITY TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO CITIZENS, AND IT ASKED FOR GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE BALDIZAN'S RESIGNATION BECAUSE "HE HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN INCOMPETENT IN DOING HIS JOB."

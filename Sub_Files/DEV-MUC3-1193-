[TEXT] THE NATIONAL POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THE "PATRIOTIC LIBERATION FRONT" [FRENTE PATRIOTICO DE LIBERACION] BOMBED THREE IMPORTANT PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN LIMA TODAY, CAUSING A LOT OF PROPERTY DAMAGE BUT NO CASUALTIES. A POLICE SOURCE REPORTED THAT GROUPS FROM THIS NEW TERRORIST MOVEMENT ATTACKED THE CITY HALL OF SAN JUAN DE MIRAFLORES, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LIMA; AN ELECTROLIMA [LIMA ELECTRIC POWER ENTERPRISE] OFFICE; AND AN ENTELPERU [NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISE OF PERU] OFFICE IN THE MIRAFLORES AND SURCO DISTRICTS OF LIMA. THE SOURCE ADDED: "THIS NEW TERRORIST ORGANIZATION WANTS TO INTIMIDATE THE PEOPLE TO PREVENT THEM FROM EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY (8 APRIL)." IN THESE ELECTIONS THE PEOPLE WILL ELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, TWO VICE PRESIDENTS, 180 DEPUTIES, AND 60 SENATORS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST 10 MILLION PERUVIANS WILL VOTE. UP TO NOW THE POLICE HAVE ATTRIBUTED THE MOST SERIOUS ATTACKS AND CRIMES TO THE MAOIST "SHINING PATH" GROUP AND THE MARXIST "TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT" (MRTA). THE "SHINING PATH" AND THE "MRTA" ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 700 PEOPLE THIS YEAR, INCLUDING A DOZEN CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESSIONAL SEATS AND REGIONAL ASSEMBLIES AND SOME THIRTY MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES.

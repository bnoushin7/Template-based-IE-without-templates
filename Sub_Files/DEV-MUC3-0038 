[TEXT] ARMANDO CALDERON SOL, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA), THE RULING SALVADORAN PARTY, TODAY CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO ANY POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MILITARY PERSONNEL IMPLICATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS. "IT IS SOMETHING SO HORRENDOUS, SO MONSTROUS, THAT WE MUST INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FMLN (FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT) STAGED THIS ASSASSINATION TO DISCREDIT THE GOVERNMENT," CALDERON SOL SAID. SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI IMPLICATED FOUR OFFICERS, INCLUDING ONE COLONEL, AND FIVE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER AT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. ACCORDING TO CALDERON SOL, THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT "IS DUTYBOUND TO UNCOVER THE MURDERERS OF THE JESUITS AND TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY LINK BETWEEN THE SOLDIERS INVOLVED AND THE FMLN." "THOSE RESPONSIBLE ACTED ON THEIR OWN, TO CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT AND DISCREDIT IT. IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE AN ISOLATED ACT. INVESTIGATIONS ARE POINTING TO SOME KIND OF CONSPIRACY," THE PRESIDENT OF THE RIGHTIST ARENA PARTY SAID. IN ADDITION, CALDERON SOL ASKED THE GOVERNMENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA TO CARRY OUT AN "EXHAUSTIVE" INVESTIGATION TO ENSURE THAT THE MURDER OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES "DOES NOT GO UNPUNISHED." CALDERON NOTED THAT "OQUELI HAD CLEARLY RENOUNCED THE POSITION OF ARMED STRUGGLE IN FAVOR OF A PROGRAM FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION." OQUELI COLINDRES, A SALVADORAN LEADER OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL, WAS FOUND DEAD ALONG WITH GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ON 13 JANUARY IN A TOWN IN SOUTHEASTERN GUATEMALA NEAR THE SALVADORAN BORDER.

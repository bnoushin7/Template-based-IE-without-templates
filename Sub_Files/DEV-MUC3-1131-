[TEXT] [CONTINUED] BUSH MET ON 15 FEBRUARY IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS (COLOMBIA) WITH HIS COUNTERPARTS ALAN GARCIA OF PERU, JAIME PAZ OF BOLIVIA, AND VIRGILIO BARCO OF COLOMBIA IN WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE "DRUG SUMMIT." U.S. PRIEST FRANCISCO AMICO FERRARI, KIDNAPPED ON 15 FEBRUARY IN CALI, WAS RELEASED ON 19 FEBRUARY BY THE ELN WITH A MESSAGE ABOUT "OPERATION COLOMBIA," WHICH DENOUNCES U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE "DIRTY WAR" WITH WHICH COLOMBIA IS AFFLICTED. IN TODAY'S COMMUNIQUE THE GUERRILLAS SAY "THE UNITED STATES HAS MILITARY ADVISERS IN THE COLOMBIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS TO DIRECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRTY WAR." THEY ALSO DENOUNCE "THE DIRECT LEADERSHIP OF U.S. ADVISERS IN INTELLIGENCE AND MILITARY REPRESSION OPERATIONS IN THE AREAS OF CONFLICT." THE ELN IS ALSO STILL HOLDING SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE SENATOR JORGE SEDANO GONZALEZ, KIDNAPPED ON 9 FEBRUARY NEAR BUCARAMANGA, IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, ALONG WITH HIS SECRETARY JORGE MESA, WHO WAS RELEASED ON MONDAY. THE ELN RELEASED MESA WITH A MESSAGE FOR FORMER SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PRESIDENT MISAEL PASTRANA (1970-1974), REITERATING THAT SEDANO WILL BE RELEASED ONLY IF HE DECLARES THAT HE IS OPPOSED TO THE DIRTY WAR AND REVEALS THE WHEREABOUTS OF FERNANDO PORRAS, AN ELN MEMBER WHO DISAPPEARED IN BUCARAMANGA ON 5 FEBRUARY. ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, PORRAS WAS ARRESTED AND "DISAPPEARED" BY THE 5TH ARMY BRIGADE, WHICH DENIES THIS. THE ELN IS THE ONLY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLA GROUP THAT HAS PERSISTED IN THE ARMED STRUGGLE. THE FIVE OTHER REBEL GROUPS HAVE DECLARED UNILATERAL TRUCES TO GUARANTEE A CLIMATE OF PEACE FOR THE UPCOMING ELECTIONS. THESE GROUPS ARE THE COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA, THE MAOIST POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY, THE TROTSKYIST [REVOLUTIONARY] WORKERS PARTY, AND THE INDIAN "QUINTIN LAME" MOVEMENT, IN ADDITION TO THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT, WHICH IS ABOUT TO CONCLUDE A PEACE PROCESS BEGUN 16 MONTHS AGO.

[TEXT] U.S. PRIEST FRANCISCO AMICO WAS KIDNAPPED TODAY IN THE CITY OF CALI BY AN UNIDENTIFIED GROUP. THIS WAS REPORTED BY ANOTHER COLOMBIAN PRIEST, RAFAEL LOPERA, WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE "BASILIAN COMMUNITY," TO WHICH AMICO BELONGS. ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KIDNAPPING, IT COULD BE PART OF THE "OPERATION COLOMBIA," ANNOUNCED BY THE PRO-CASTRIST ARMY OF NATIONAL LILBERATION, CAMILIST UNION GUERRRILLA GROUP (UC-ELN) IN PROTEST FOR PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S VISIT TO COLOMBIA. TWO OTHER U.S. CITIZENS WERE KIDNAPPED ON 12 AND 13 FEBRUARY BY A UC-ELN "NELSON MANDELA" COMMAND GROUP IN MEDELLIN, 250 KM NORTHEAST OF BOGOTA. THEY WERE ARTHUR DONELLEY, AN INDUSTRIALIST WHO WAS RELEASED ON 13 FEBRUARY WITH A MESSAGE WHICH PROTESTED THE BUSH VISIT TO COLOMBIA, AND PROFESSOR DAVID LESLIE KENT, WHO IS STILL BEING HELD BY HIS CAPTORS. PRIEST RAFAEL LOPERA SAID THAT THE KIDNAPPED PRIEST IS A PARISH PRIEST AT THE "ANDRES SANIN" NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF CALI, A CITY LOCATED 400 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA. LOPERA ADDED THAT "THE BASILIAN COMMUNITY HAS EIGHT MEMBERS, FOUR OF WHOM ARE PRIESTS." HE REPORTED THAT AMICO DISAPPEARED THIS MORNING ON HIS WAY TO THE "SISTERS OF THERESA OF CALCUTA" NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE HE WAS GOING TO OFFICIATE A MASS.

[TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES DENIED TODAY THAT THEIR PLANES HAD BOMBED A REFUGEE CAMP AND CIVILIAN SETTLEMENTS IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF CHALATENANGO AND MORAZAN, LOCATED NORTH AND NORTHEAST OF SAN SALVADOR, AS RELIGIOUS SOURCES HAD REPORTED YESTERDAY. A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED BY THE ARMED FORCES STATES THAT FIVE PERSONS, INCLUDING FOUR MINORS, WERE KILLED, NOT AS A RESULT OF THE BOMBINGS, "BUT AS A RESULT OF THE CLASHES" BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND GUERRILLAS AT THE "CORRAL DE LAS PIEDRAS" REFUGEE CAMP IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT. THE ARMED FORCES ACCUSED THE GUERRILLAS OF FIRING ROCKETS "THAT HIT SEVERAL HOUSES," AND IT REPORTED THAT A SOLDIER AND SIX GUERRILLAS WERE KILLED IN THE CLASHES, WHICH LASTED BETWEEN 0600 AND 1400. HOWEVER, EDUARDO ALAS, THE BISHOP OF CHALATENANGO, TOLD THE MEDIA TODAY THAT FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND AT LEAST 14 CIVILIANS WERE WOUNDED WHEN THE CAMP WAS ATTACKED FROM THE AIR. "ACCORDING TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY," ALAS SAID, "A ROCKET OR A GRENADE-TYPE DEVICE FELL ON ONE OF THE HOUSES WITH MANY PEOPLE INSIDE, INCLUDING CHILDREN. I SAW THE MUTILATED BODIES OF THE CHILDREN AND HOLES IN THE ROOF. THERE WAS A LOT OF MACHINEGUN FIRE." MOREOVER, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) CONDEMNED THE "COWARDLY ATTACK" ON THE REFUGEE HOMES, WHICH, HE SAID, WERE "HIGLY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIED AS CIVILIAN HOUSING." "THIS INCIDENT SHOWS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMITMENT BY THE ARMED FORCES TO REACH A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION, AND IT REAFFIRMS THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND TO USE MILITARY POWER TO REACH A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION SO THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED," THE FMLN SAID IN A COMMUNIQUE RELEASED TODAY. THE FMLN ALSO CONDEMNED AN ALLEGED BOMBING OF THE TOWN OF CACAOPERA, IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT, WHICH THE ARMED FORCES HAVE DENIED. ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, A WOMAN WAS WOUNDED AND A SUGAR CANE HARVEST WAS DESTROYED BY THE BOMBS, BUT ACCORDING TO COL MAURICIO VARGAS, MILITARY CHIEF OF THE REGION, "THERE WAS NO BOMBING, BUT CLASHES WITH A GROUP OF GUERRILLAS WITH THE SUPPORT OF HELICOPTERS." THE MILITARY CHIEF PROMISED, HOWEVER, TO CARRY OUT THE "PERTINENT INVESTIGATIONS TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE REGION."

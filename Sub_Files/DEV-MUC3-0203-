[TEXT] OFFICIAL SOURCES REPORTED TODAY THAT THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA GROUPS HAVE INCREASED THEIR SABOTAGE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, LEAVING 40 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL TERRITORY WITHOUT ELECTRICITY, WHILE INTERMITTENT BLACKOUTS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THE ENTIRE EASTERN ZONE OF THE COUNTRY WAS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY TODAY, ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION (CEL), WHICH STATED THAT ON MONDAY, FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) GUERRILLAS BLEW UP SEVERAL STRUCTURES IN THAT REGION. THE REPORT ADDED THAT THE SABOTAGE OCCURRED ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, WHERE OTHER STRUCTURES WERE ALSO BLOWN UP EARLY THIS MORNING. IN THIS CAPITAL, FMLN URBAN COMMANDOES BLEW UP AT LEAST THREE POLES SUPPORTING SECONDARY LINES, AND AN AS YET UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF POLES AND TOWERS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE COUNTRY'S CENTRAL AND WESTERN REGION.

[TEXT] EDUARDO COLORADO, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF EL SALVADOR, STATED TODAY THAT THERE IS A PLAN, POSSIBLY PREPARED BY THE GUERRILLAS, TO ATTACK SALVADORAN BISHOPS AND "CREATE GREATER PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT" OF ALFREDO CRISTIANI. IN A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE OFFICIAL SAID THAT "IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE FOR THE BISHOPS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY OR NOT APPEAR IN PUBLIC." COLORADO, WHO DID NOT WANT WANT TO PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE ALLEGED PLAN, SAID THAT THE MAIN TARGET MIGHT BE MSGR GREGORIO ROSA CHAVEZ, AUXILIARY BISHOP OF SAN SALVADOR, SINCE SEVERAL OF HIS RELATIVES ARE GUERRILLAS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT PERSONS WHO HAVE LOST RELATIVES IN THE WAR "MIGHT CARRY OUT THE PLAN" THAT "MIGHT BE ORGANIZED BY THE TERRORISTS TO CREATE A GREATER CRISES FOR THE GOVERNMENT." THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID HE SENT A LETTER TO POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKING HIM TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY THE BISHOPS WHO REPORTEDLY SUPPORT THE SO-CALLED "PEOPLE'S CHURCH." ACCORDING TO COLORADO, THIS "PEOPLE'S CHURCH" IS RESPONSIBLE IN PART FOR THE VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY. HE DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH BISHOPS ARE MENTIONED IN THE LETTER SENT TO THE POPE, BUT VARIOUS SOURCES INSIST HE IS REFERRING TO ARCHBISHOP ARTURO RIVERA Y DAMAS AND AUXILIARY BISHOP ROSA CHAVEZ, WHO SUPPORT A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY. IN THE LETTER, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUGGESTS THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II REMOVE THESE SALVADORAN BISHOPS SINCE, HE INSISTS, "IT IS 1,000 TIMES BETTER TO PREVENT THESE INCIDENTS THAN TO HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THEM." THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LETTER TO THE POPE WAS SENT 2 DAYS AFTER SIX JESUITS (FIVE SPANIARDS AND ONE SALVADORAN) AND TWO WOMEN WERE KILLED IN SAN SALVADOR BY A GROUP OF 30 TO 40 MEN WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES.

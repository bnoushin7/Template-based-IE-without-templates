[EXCERPT] SAN SALVADOR, 19 NOV (ACAN-EFE) -- SALVADORAN CLERGYMEN FROM THE CATHOLIC, LUTHERAN, AND BAPTIST CHURCHES HAVE CLAIMED THAT THEY ARE BEING "PERSECUTED" BY GROUPS OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY IN THE STYLE OF THE ULTRARIGHTIST "DEATH SQUADS" MEDARDO GOMEZ, A LUTHERAN CHURCH BISHOP, SAID TODAY THAT CLERGYMEN ARE SUBJECT TO "PERSECUTION." HE SAID THAT MEMBERS OF THE POLICE FORCE ARE "BESIEGING" SHELTERS ESTABLISHED BY THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO BENEFIT THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS OF THE FIGHTING. THE LUTHERAN BISHOP SAID THAT SIX GERMANS, FOUR U.S. CITIZENS, A CANADIAN, AND A SPANIARD WERE ARRESTED BY THE TREASURY POLICE 2 DAYS AGO IN A CHURCH IN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE TROOPS WERE LOOKING FOR "GUERRILLA COLLABORATORS." THE FOREIGNERS WERE DETAINED AFTER HAVING HELPED TO AID CIVILIANS WHO TOOK REFUGE IN CHURCHES IN SAN SALVADOR AFTER FLEEING FROM THE BLOODY CLASHES BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND REBELS IN THE MEJICANOS, CUSCATANCINGO, ZACAMIL, CIUDAD DELGADO, SAN JACINTO, AND SOYAPANGO NEIGHBORHOODS, LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE CAPITAL. SEVERAL PRIESTS, INCLUDING DANIEL LOPEZ, A SPANIARD, HAD TO EVACUATE THEIR PARISHES, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE EMBATTLED AREAS, AFTER THE CHURCHES WERE SURROUNDED BY SOLDIERS. LOPEZ HAD TO LEAVE THE SANTA MARIA DE LOS POBRES CHURCH IN THE LA CHACRA SLUM AREA IN EASTERN SAN SALVADOR AFTER IT WAS BOMBED BY THE AIR FORCE, ACCORDING TO ONE OF LOPEZ' ASSISTANTS, WHO IS ALSO A SPANIARD. RELIGIOUS SOURCES TOLD THE PRESS THAT TREASURY POLICEMEN ASSAULTED SOME 50 REFUGEES IN THE SAN ROQUE SHELTER, LOCATED IN SOUTHERN SAN SALVADOR, WHEN THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR A PRIEST NAMED CORTEZ. THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS SAID THAT THE PERSECUTION WAS STEPPED UP AFTER THE START OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE IN THE CAPITAL, WHICH BEGAN ON 11 NOVEMBER AND SO FAR HAS LEFT SOME 1,000 DEAD, INCLUDING 6 JESUIT PRIESTS WHO WERE ASSASSINATED.

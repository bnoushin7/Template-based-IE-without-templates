[TEXT] THE SALVADORAN ARMY'S COUNTERATTACK AGAINST REBEL POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS, ON THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE CAPITAL CITY, WAS SUSPENDED AT 1745 (2345 GMT), 1 HOUR AFTER IT BEGAN AND SO FAR THERE ARE NO REPORTS ON THE RESULTS OF IT. TWO COLUMNS OF SOME 100 SALVADORAN ARMY TROOPS, ARMED WITH RIFLES AND ARTILLERY WEAPONS, STARTED TO ATTACK ABOUT 150 GUERRILLAS WHO CONTROL AMPLE POSITIONS IN MEJICANOS WHERE SOME 125,000 PEOPLE LIVE. DURING THAT HOUR, STRONG EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD NEAR MEJICANOS; THEY LATER STOPPED WHEN A HEAVY RAIN FELL FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. THERE ARE NO TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE AREA; THEREFORE, IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE BALANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S COUNTERATTACK. MEANWHILE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN THE CONACASTE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SOYAPANGO, ALSO IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, FIVE PRIVATE HOMES WERE STRAFFED BY ARMY HELICOPTERS. THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED YET. ACCORDING TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IN SAN SALVADOR, THE NATIONAL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 12 NOVEMBER BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) AGAINST ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT HAS RESULTED IN 305 DEAD AND 373 WOUNDED, INCLUDING GUERRILLAS, SOLDIERS, AND CIVILIANS.

[TEXT] EL SALVADOR'S LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF LABOR UNIONS, ASSOCIATIONS, AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS TODAY REGRETTED THE LEFTIST GUERRILLAS' DECISION TO SUSPEND THEIR DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE IS NOT "IRREVOCABLE." REVERAND EDGAR PALACIOS, THE MAIN REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BAPTIST CHURCH AND COORDINATOR OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE FOR THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE FOR PEACE, COMPRISING ABOUT 65 ORGANIZATIONS, TOLD THE PRESS ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S RIGHTIST GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION IT WANTS PEACE. THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT'S (FMLN) GENERAL COMMAND ANNOUNCED IN A COMMUNIQUE ON 2 NOVEMBER THAT IT HAD CANCELED ANOTHER ROUND OF THE DIALOGUE SCHEDULED FOR 20-21 NOVEMBER IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, WHICH WERE TO CONTINUE TALKS THAT BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER TO END A 10-YEAR CIVIL WAR. THE REBELS CLAIMED AN INTENSIFICATION OF REPRESSION AND BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES FOR THE MURDER OF 10 UNION MEMBERS IN A DYNAMITE ATTACK IN SAN SALVADOR ON 31 OCTOBER AND FOR OTHER ATTACKS ON HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND LEFTIST POLITICIANS. GUILLERMO ROJAS, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL UNITY OF SALVADORAN WORKERS (UNTS), THE MAIN OPPOSITION LABOR UNION, TERMED THE DIALOGUE SUSPENSION AS "LOGICAL." ROJAS SAID CRISTIANI HAS GIVEN NO INDICATIONS HE INDEED WANTS PEACE; QUITE THE CONTRARY, HE HAS "DECLARED WAR ON THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BY ORDERING ATTACKS ON LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS." MEANWHILE, ARONETTE DIAZ, PRESIDENT OF THE LEFTIST NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION (UDN), SAID THE CURRENT SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR IS WORRISOME BECAUSE "IT CANNOT TAKE ANY MORE VIOLENCE THAN IT IS ALREADY ENDURING." "THE ONLY THING LEFT IS FOR TANKS TO BE DEPLOYED TO MACHINEGUN ALL OF US," SHE ADDED.

[EXCERPT] MEDICAL SOURCES REPORTED TODAY THAT THE IRISH NUN, SISTER MARY STANISLAUS MACKEY, WHO WAS SHOT IN EL SALVADOR BY SEVERAL UNIDENTIFIED MEN, IS STILL IN SERIOUS CONDITION, BUT OUT OF DANGER. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE HOSPITAL TO WHICH THE NUN WAS TAKEN AFTER BEING WOUNDED ALONG WITH TWO OTHER NUNS ON 21 JUNE, SAID: "THE NUN UNDERWENT SURGERY TWICE AND SHE WILL MOST LIKELY LOSE HER LEFT EYE, BUT SHE IS OUT OF DANGER." THE TWO OTHER WOUNDED NUNS ARE U.S. CITIZEN SISTER ANA MARIA BRANGAN AND SALVADORAN SISTER JUANA MARGARITA FLORES. CHURCH SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT MACKEY IS NOT A U.S. CITIZEN, BUT AN IRISH CITIZEN WHO WAS SENT TO WORK IN EL SALVADOR IN 1983 SPONSORED BY THE ARCHDIOCESE OF CLEVELAND (U.S.A.). THE SAME SOURCES TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT MACKEY, 72, WILL BE TAKEN TO A U.S. HOSPITAL WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS, BUT NO FURTHER DETAILS WERE GIVEN. SALVADORAN COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER MAURICIO SANDOVAL CONDEMNED THE ATTACK ON THE NUNS AND SAID THAT SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES ARE CONDUCTING IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATIONS TO APPREHEND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ATTACK.

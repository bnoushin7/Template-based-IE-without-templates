[TEXT] SEVERAL SALVADORAN LEFTWING PARTIES AND LABOR UNIONS HAVE SCHEDULED A GENERAL STRIKE ON 1 NOVEMBER TO PROTEST THE ATTACK PERPETRATED TODAY AGAINST A LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS, CAUSING 9 DEATHS AND INJURING MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE. SEVEN LEFTWING PARTY LEADERS WHO CALLED THE STRIKE, HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, AND LABOR UNIONS ARE ACCUSING THE ARMY AND THE "MOST RADICAL" SECTORS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PERPETRATING THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION (FENASTRAS). HUMBERTO CENTENO, ONE OF THE TOP LEADERS OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF SALVADORAN WORKERS (UNTS), HAS ASKED THE SALVADORAN WORKERS TO STAGE A STRIKE ON 1 NOVEMBER BEGINNING AT 0600 (1200 GMT) THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL AND LABOR LEADERS DESCRIBED THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST THE FENASTRAS HEADQUARTERS AT NOON TODAY AS A "MASSACRE." THE ATTACK LEFT 9 PEOPLE DEAD AND MORE THAN 30 INJURED. THE ARMED FORCES CONDEMNED THE "TERRORIST ATTACK" AGAINST FENASTRAS, AND DENIED THAT THE MILITARY PERPETRATED IT. CENTENO ACCUSED DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HUMBERTO LARIOS AND ULTRA-RIGHTWING DEPUTY ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON -- LINKED BY THE OPPOSITION TO THE "DEATH SQUADS" -- OF THE "MASSACRE." "WE MUST STOP WORK TOMORROW AS A SIGN OF GRIEF AND MOURNING, AND ATTEND THE BURIALS OF OUR MASSACRED COMRADES," CENTENO SAID. THE ATTACK ON FENASTRAS IS THE SECOND ATTACK PERPETRATED AGAINST OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS IN THE PAST 24 HOURS, FOLLOWING A GUERRILLA ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF ON 30 OCTOBER, WHICH CAUSED THE DEATH OF 1 CIVILIAN AND INJURED 15 PEOPLE.

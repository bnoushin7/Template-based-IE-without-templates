[TEXT] THE NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS DENIED THE CHARGES THAT THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT HAS LEVELED AGAINST THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA REGARDING THE 7 JANUARY ASSASSINATION IN TEGUCIGALPA OF MANUEL RUGAMA, KNOWN AS COMMANDER AURELIANO, THE SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES IN HONDURAS. HONDURAN NATIONAL POLICE ON MONDAY PRESENTED TO THE PRESS HONDURAN JUAN BAUTISTA NUNEZ AMADOR AND NICARAGUAN LUIS FERNANDO ORDONEZ REYES, WHO TOLD REPORTERS THAT COMMANDER AURELIANO WAS ASSASSINATED ON ORDERS FROM JOSE DE JESUS PENA, THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY CHIEF OF SECURITY. MERCEDES BORGE, PRESS DIRECTOR AT THE NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTRY, SAID THERE IS NO JOSE DE JESUS PENA EMPLOYED AT THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA AND THAT AURELIANO'S ASSASSINATION WAS PERPETRATED BY THREE INDIVIDUALS AND NOT TWO, AS THE HONDURAN POLICE CLAIM. BORGE SAID THAT WHILE NICARAGUA MAKES SERIOUS AND FORMAL PROPOSALS TO ADVANCE PEACE EFFORTS, IT IS WORRISOME THAT HONDURAN MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE CREATING SITUATIONS THAT COULD UNLEASH CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN TWO ATTACKS ON THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA, BORGE SAID. SHE ADDED THAT THE HONDURAN POLICE REPORT CONFLICTS WITH THE AUTOPSY REPORT, BECAUSE IN HIS STATEMENT, NUNEZ AMADOR REFERRED TO ONLY A .38-CALIBER REVOLVER AND A .45-CALIBER PISTOL, WHICH WERE NOT FOUND ON RUGAMA'S BODY OR IN HIS VEHICLE.

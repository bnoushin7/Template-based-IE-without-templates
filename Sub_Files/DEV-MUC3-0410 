[TEXT] TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACKS WERE PERPETRATED IN MEDELLIN LAST EVENING SHORTLY BEFORE THE CURFEW WAS ENFORCED. ONE ATTACK WAS AIMED AT THE ECOPETROL [COLOMBIAN PETROLEUM ENTERPRISE] FUEL STORAGE TANKS AND THE OTHER AGAINST THE COUNTRY CLUB. HOWEVER, THE CURFEW RESULTED IN A MIRACLE LAST NIGHT: NOT A SINGLE PERSON WAS KILLED IN MEDELLIN. THE DECREASE IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION INCLUDING BUSES, JITNEYS, AND EVEN PRIVATE VEHICLES BEGAN AROUND 2100. PEOPLE LIVING IN MEDELLIN AND ITAGUI RODE CLINGING TO THE VEHICLES' DOORS IN CLUSTERS IN ORDER TO GET HOME ON TIME AND AVOID ARREST BY THE AUTHORITIES.

[TEXT] THE WAVE OF CRIMINAL ATTACKS TO WHICH COLOMBIAN JOURNALISTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING SUBJECTED CONTINUED LAST NIGHT WHEN WILLIAM BENDECK OLIVELLA, DIRECTOR OF A RADIO NEWSCAST IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF MONTERIA, WAS KILLED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS. ACCORDING TO REPORTS RECEIVED IN BOGOTA, THE NEWSMAN, 57, WAS ABOUT TO ENTER HIS HOME WHEN HE WAS GUNNED DOWN BY SEVERAL ARMED MEN. BENDECK OLIVELLA HAD BEEN PRESS ASSISTANT TO NICARAGUAN DICTATOR ANASTASIO SOMOZA, BUT WENT TO COLOMBIA AFTER THE TRIUMPH OF THE SANDINIST REVOLUTION. BENDECK OLIVELLA IS THE SECOND NEWSMAN TO BE MURDERED THIS WEEK. ON TUESDAY, SEVERAL GUNMEN KILLED ROBERTO SARASTY BOTERO, WHO WORKED FOR THE CARACOL RADIO NETWORK IN MEDELLIN. ALTHOUGH THE AUTHORITIES DO NOT YET HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION, THE POSSIBILITY THAT BENDECK OLIVELLA MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR POLITICAL REASONS HAS NOT BEEN RULED OUT SINCE HE WAS A POLITICAL SPECIALIST. FOR MORE THAN A MONTH, NEWSMEN IN COLOMBIA HAVE BEEN FACING A SERIOUS THREAT FROM THE DRUG TRAFFICKING MAFIA, WHICH EVEN PARTIALLY DESTROYED THE MAIN OFFICES OF THE BOGOTA MORNING PAPER EL ESPECTADOR, IN REPRISAL FOR THE PAPER'S HARSH ATTACKS ON THE COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.

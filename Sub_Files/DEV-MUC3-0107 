[TEXT] RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND UNION LEADERS HEADED THE FUNERAL MARCH OF THE 10 UNION MEMBERS KILLED IN THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] HEADQUARTERS, LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF SAN SALVADOR, ONLY 200 METERS FROM THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS. THE UNION MEMBERS' BODIES, INCLUDING FENASTRAS LEADER FEDE ELIZABETH VELASQUEZ, WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL THOUSAND WORKERS WHO SHOUTED ANTIGOVERNMENT SLOGANS AND CARRIED RED FLOWERS. THE MARCH TOOK PLACE AMIDST MUCH TENSION BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF MILITARY TROOPS IN SAN SALVADOR'S MAIN STREETS AND BECAUSE UNION MEMBERS STOPPED AT LEAST 30 POLICEMEN DRESSED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES WHO, ACCORDING TO THE UNIONISTS, HAD INFILTRATED THE DEMONSTRATION. THE MARCH ENDED AT THE LA BERMEJA CEMETERY, WHERE THE UNION MEMBERS' BODIES WERE BURIED.

[COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] [TEXT] REGARDING THE DEATH OF EDGARD CHACON, TODAY, 30 JUNE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] STATES THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE FMLN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEATH OF EDGARD CHACON. 2. EDGARD CHACON, IDEOLOGIST OF THE ORLANDO DE SOLA GROUP, WAS KILLED AS THE RESULT OF A WAR THAT HAS BEEN UNLEASHED AMONG RIGHTIST GROUPS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF CIA [CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY] OPERATIVES. THIS ASSASSINATION WAS A RESPONSE FROM THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI FACTION, WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE CIA, TO THE KILLING OF [LATE MINISTER OF THE PRESIDENCY] RODRIGUEZ PORTH, WHOSE ASSASSINATION HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON FACTION. WE URGE THE PEOPLE AND THE MEDIA TO BE ON THE ALERT AND NOT TO BE CONFUSED BY WHAT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE KILLINGS SAY. [SIGNED] FMLN [DATED] 30 JUNE 1989

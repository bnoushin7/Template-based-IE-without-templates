[TEXT] OFFICIAL GUATEMALAN SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE BODIES OF FOUR OF THE NINE GUATEMALAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED OVER THE PAST 2 WEEKS BY DEATH SQUADS WERE FOUND TODAY NEAR THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF GUATEMALA CITY. THE VICTIMS, WHOSE BODIES SHOWED SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN TORTURED AND CUT WITH KNIVES, WERE IDENTIFIED AS SILVIA MARIA AZURDIA AND VICTOR HUGO RODRIGUEZ (A MARRIED COUPLE), BOTH STUDYING AT THE SAN CARLOS UNIVERSITY POLITICAL SCIENCE SCHOOL; AND CARLOS HUMBERTO CABRERA RIVERA, A TEACHER LEADER. THESE THREE PEOPLE DISAPPEARED ON 23 AUGUST. IN ADDITION, THE AUTHORITIES IDENTIFIED THE BODY OF LEONEL CHUTA CAMEY, OF THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE SCHOOL, WHO WAS ABDUCTED ON FRIDAY, 8 SEPTEMBER. ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, THE BODIES WERE TAKEN TO THE GUATEMALA CITY JUDICIAL MORGUE. THE DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES INCREASED THE TENSION THAT PREVAILS IN THE COUNTRY AND MADE GUATEMALANS FEAR THAT THE OTHER FIVE MISSING STUDENTS MAY HAVE FACED THE SAME FATE. MEANWHILE, THE POLICE SAID YESTERDAY, 9 SEPTEMBER, THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE "ANY CLUES" ON THE KIDNAPPERS' IDENTITY.

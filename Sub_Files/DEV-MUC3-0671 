A BOMB WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED BY TERRORISTS IN THE MONTEBON NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ALSO DEFUSED. MEDICINES WERE ALSO FOUND IN THE MONTEBON AREA. THE MEJICANOS SECTOR IS ALREADY UNDER CONTROL. THERE ARE ONLY SMALL CLASHES IN THE ZACAMIL AREA. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO STRESS OUR GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION TO ACHIEVE PEACE FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE. WE KNOW THAT THIS RIDICULOUS ACTION BY THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] HAS ONE OBJECTIVE WHICH IS INTENSIFYING TERROR, PAIN, AND DEATH AMONG THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

[TEXT] IT HAS BEEN LEARNED FROM POLICE SOURCES THAT ANOTHER DEVICE HAS EXPLODED ON THE DOWNTOWN CORNER OF SARMIENTO AND SAN MARTIN STREETS, WHERE MANY BANKING INSTITUTIONS ARE LOCATED. THE FEDERAL POLICE BOMB SQUAD IS TRYING TO DETERMINE THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THIS SECOND BOMB, WHICH EXPLODED 30 MINUTES AFTER THE ONE THAT DAMAGED THE WINDOWS OF THE VELOX BANK.

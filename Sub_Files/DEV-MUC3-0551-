[TEXT] FOUR MEN, WHO HAD 250 KG OF DYNAMITE WITH THEM, WERE ARRESTED TODAY BY THE BOGOTA POLICE WHO SAID THEY HAD DISMANTLED A BAND OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SOWING TERROR IN THIS CITY. IN ORDER NOT TO HINDER THE INVESTIGATIONS, THE POLICE DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE CAPTURED DURING THE INTELLIGENCE OPERATION IN SOUTHWESTERN BOGOTA. A POLICE SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT THE FOUR MEN WERE ARRESTED, FOLLOWING THE 5 OCTOBER ARREST OF A MAN WHO WAS CARRYING 15 KG OF DYNAMITE IN A TAXI. SHORTLY BEFORE THAT, ANOTHER TERRORIST WAS NEARLY LYNCHED BY SOME PEOPLE WHO CAPTURED HIM IN NORTHERN BOGOTA, AFTER HE PLACED AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN A PRINTSHOP. A POLICE PATROL WENT TO THE SITE AND PREVENTED THE PRIVATE CITIZENS AND BUSINESSMEN AFFECTED BY THE BOMBS FROM SERIOUSLY HARMING THE MAN WHO WAS, NONETHELESS, SEVERELY BEATEN. THE BOGOTA POLICE SAID THAT THE ARREST OF THESE SIX TERRORISTS IN THE LAST 24 HOURS AIDED IN UNCOVERING A PLAN TO DESTROY AN ELECTRICAL GENERATING CENTER. A POLICE SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE ARRESTED, THANKS TO THE COOPERATION OF THE PEOPLE. HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE QUICK REACTION BY A GROUP OF BUSINESSMEN LED TO THE ARREST OF ONE OF THE TERRORISTS. THE SECOND TERRORIST WAS ARRESTED BY THE POLICE AFTER A TAXI DRIVER REFUSED TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND REPORTED HIM AS A SUSPECT. WHEN THE SUSPECT WAS INTERROGATED, HE DISCLOSED INFORMATION THAT ALLOWED THE POLICE TO LOCATE A HOUSE IN SOUTHERN BOGOTA WHERE FOUR MEN WERE HIDING 250 KG OF DYNAMITE. THE TERRORISM AFFECTING SEVERAL COLOMBIAN CITIES IS THE RESPONSE FROM DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO WHO DECLARED WAR ON THEM IN AUGUST.

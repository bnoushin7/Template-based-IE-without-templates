[TEXT] GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS MORALES SAID TODAY THAT A "FOREIGN COMMANDO" KILLED HECTOR OQUELI, LEADER OF THE SALVADORAN LEFTIST PARTY NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), AND GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER GILDA FLORES IN GUATEMALA. MORALES SAID AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS THAT THE INTENTION OF THE "TERRORIST COMMANDO" WAS CAPTURING OQUELI ALIVE TO TAKE HIM TO EL SALVADOR BUT THAT "SOMETHING MADE THEM CHANGE THEIR PLANS." MORALES STRESSED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE "FOREIGN COMMANDO," THE NATIONALITY AND ORIGIN OF WHOM HE DID NOT SPECIFY, HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR MONTHS, ADDING THAT "IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY TERRORIST ATTACKS." MORALES SAID THAT THE GROUP HAS KILLED SEVERAL PEOPLE AND HAS CARRIED OUT VARIOUS BOMB ATTACKS IN GUATEMALA. ASKED ABOUT A STATEMENT BY SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER MARIO SOLORZANO, WHO SAID THAT SALVADORAN AND GUATEMALAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS OPERATE JOINTLY IN GUATEMALA, MORALES SAID THAT "THIS IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION." "WE CANNOT SAY WHAT COUNTRY THIS TERRORIST COMMANDO CAME FROM; HOWEVER, WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN MEASURES TO COUNTER ITS ACTIVITIES IN OUR NATIONAL TERRITORY," HE STRESSED. OUR GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LET THIS GROUP "DEFAME" GUATEMALA WITH ITS ACTIVITIES. THERE IS ALREADY A SPECIAL UNIT WITHIN THE SECURITY FORCES IN CHARGE OF LOCATING THE KILLERS OF OQUELI AND FLORES. ACCORDING TO THE INITIAL REPORTS RECEIVED BY THE POLICE, THE KIDNAPPING TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY WHEN OQUELI AND FLORES WERE HEADING TO LA AURORA AIRPORT IN THIS CAPITAL. THE VEHICLE IN WHICH THEY WERE TRAVELING, WHICH WAS FOUND NEAR THE AIRPORT, WAS INTERCEPTED BY ANOTHER CAR, WHOSE OCCUPANTS FORCED GILDA FLORES OUT OF THE CAR WHILE OQUELI TRIED TO ESCAPE, MORALES SAID.

[TEXT] ORLANDO QUITENO, SPOKESMAN OF THE LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION, HAS REPORTED THAT IN THE PAST FEW HOURS, THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DESTROYED AT LEAST 10 POWER TRANSMISSION TOWERS, DAMAGING SEVEN HIGH VOLTAGE LINES IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. QUITENO SAID THAT THE NEW SABOTAGE CAUSED A 25-PERCENT ENERGY LOSS IN SAN SALVADOR. THE DAMAGE TO THE ENERGY SYSTEM CAUSED TRAFFIC JAMS IN SAN SALVADOR AND A VIRTUAL PARALYSIS IN ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF ENERGY RATIONING. THE RESUMPTION OF THE SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ENERGY SYSTEM IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE RESUMPTION OF REBEL ATTACKS AGAINST BROTHELS, TWO OF WHICH WERE DESTROYED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, ALTHOUGH NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. THE BROTHELS REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BECAUSE IT IS BELIEVED THAT WOMEN ARE EXPLOITED THERE. IN ADDITION, URBAN GUERRILLAS BLEW UP A PUBLIC BUS IN A NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATED NORTH OF SAN SALVADOR; NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

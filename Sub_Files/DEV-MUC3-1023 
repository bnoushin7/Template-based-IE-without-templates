ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE BRIGADES, THE VICTIMS WERE TWO CANADIAN WOMEN AND AN AMERICAN MALE CITIZEN. THE REPORT STATES THAT THE THREE MEMBERS WERE RETURNING TO THEIR HEADQUARTERS WHEN THEY WERE INTERCEPTED AND ATTACKED BY TWO YOUNG MEN WHO STABBED THEM. THE AGGRESSORS FIRST STABBED THE TWO WOMEN IN THE CHEST, CAUSING DEEP WOUNDS. THE AMERICAN MAN TRIED TO DEFEND THE TWO WOMEN BUT HE SUFFERED CUTS ON HIS HANDS AND WRISTS, AND AROUND HIS WAIST.

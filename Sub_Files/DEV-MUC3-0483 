THE LAWYERS ALSO CLAIM THAT GALAN SARMIENTO WAS KILLED BY AN UZI SUBMACHINEGUN AND THAT THE ONE FOUND AT THE APARTMENT WHERE THE SIX SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED WAS AN INGRAM. BALLISTIC TEST RESULTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN REVEALED. THE DEFENSE LAWYERS HAVE APPEALED THE COURT DECISION, AND NOW THE COURT WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THE DECISION ISSUED BY THE THIRD PUBLIC JUDGE IS TO STAND.

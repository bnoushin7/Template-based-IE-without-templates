[TEXT] AS WE HAVE REPORTED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, HONDURAN ARMY TROOPS HAVE ENTERED SALVADORAN TERRITORY THROUGH SAN MIGUEL AND MORAZAN DEPARTMENTS TO CARRY OUT KIDNAPPINGS AND ROBBERIES AND COMMIT ABUSES AGAINST SALVADORAN CIVILIANS. HONDURAN AND SALVADORAN TROOPS CLASHED ON 6 MARCH LEAVING ONE DEAD AND ONE WOUNDED AMONG THE RANKS OF THE 10TH REGIMENT OF MARCALA, HONDURAS. THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] URGES THE GOVERNMENT OF RAFAEL CALLEJAS AND THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES' HIGH COMMAND TO ORDER THE END TO THESE INCURSIONS INTO EL SALVADOR THAT ARE AFFECTING HUMBLE CIVILIANS. AT A TIME WHEN THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD ARE CLAMORING FOR PEACE THROUGH DIALOGUE AND UNDERSTANDING AMONG NATIONS, THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT MUST PREVENT FURTHER CONFRONTATIONS AT OTHER BORDER AREAS, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HONDURAS IS BURDENED BY A SERIOUS ECONOMIC CRISIS AND REQUIRES [WORDS INDISTINCT]. THE FMLN REAFFIRMS BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ITS DETERMINATION TO MAINTAIN ITS EFFORTS IN SEARCH OF SOLUTIONS TO REGIONAL CONFLICTS. WITH THAT IN MIND, IT URGES THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT TO ASSUME ITS RESPONSIBILITY IN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED INCIDENTS.

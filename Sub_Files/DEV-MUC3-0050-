[TEXT] THE CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTRY HAS CATEGORICALLY REJECTED THE U.S. DECISION TO CITE A TREATY SIGNED WITH CHILE IN 1914, TO TURN THE MURDER CASE OF FORMER CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER ORLANDO LETELIER OVER TO AN INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF JURISTS. THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE BY FOREIGN MINISTER HERNAN FELIPE ERRAZURIZ, WHO ADDED THAT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT IS HANDLING THE SITUATION IN A SERIOUS AND PROFESSIONAL MANNER. [BEGIN RECORDING] [ERRAZURIZ] YES, ON 12 JANUARY WE RECEIVED A DIPLOMATIC NOTE WHICH WE ARE NOW STUDYING. WE CATEGORICALLY REJECT THE IMPLICIT PRESSURE ON SOMETHING WE ARE HANDLING IN A SERIOUS AND PROFESSIONAL MANNER. WE HAVE GRANTED ALL POSSIBLE COOPERATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. [END RECORDING] IN VIEW OF THIS SITUATION, THE FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT WHICH SAYS THAT THE 1914 TREATY IS BEING STUDIED TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS APPLICABLE. THE STATEMENT ADDS THAT THE TERMS USED BY THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN LAST MONDAY IN REFERRING TO THIS MATTER REPRESENT A DISTORTED AND PARTIAL VIEW, REFLECTING THE DESIRE TO IMPOSE A POSITION DISREGARDING INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. THE FOREIGN MINISTRY STATEMENT CONCLUDES BY SAYING THAT THE CHILEAN COURTS ARE PROCESSING A ROGATORY LETTER SUBMITTED THROUGH NORMAL DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS, HAVING TO DO WITH THE PROCEEDINGS BEING CARRIED OUT IN THE UNITED STATES ON THIS CRIMINAL CASE.

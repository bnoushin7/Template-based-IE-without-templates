[TEXT] THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS CHARGED IN TEGUCIGALPA TODAY THAT ON 19 FEBRUARY THE SANDINIST AIR FORCE USED AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS TO BOMB SEVERAL COMMUNITIES IN ZELAYA, MATAGALPA, AND JINOTEGA DEPARTMENTS, IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN NICARAGUA. THE REBELS DID NOT REPORT ANY DEAD OR WOUNDED IN THE ALLEGED ATTACKS, WHICH THE CONTRAS SAY ARE PART OF AN OFFENSIVE BEGUN IN THE DAYS PRIOR TO THE ELECTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY. IN A COMMUNIQUE, THE CONTRAS INDICATED THAT THEIR FIGHTERS ARE NOT ATTACKING SANDINIST MILITARY TARGETS, AND THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE NICARAGUAN MILITARY ACTION WAS TO "CREATE CONFUSION" REGARDING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. ON THE OTHER HAND, COMMANDER "FRANKLIN" OF THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE (RN) GENERAL STAFF SAID THAT THE RN WILL REMAIN "INTACT," EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT THE ELECTIONS ARE WON BY VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO, CANDIDATE OF THE NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION (UNO). "WE WILL REMAIN INTACT TO SEE IF THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSMISSION OF POWER ON 25 APRIL, IN WHICH THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE IN-DEPTH REFORMS, PARTICULARLY THE ELIMINATION OF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM," HE ADDED. THE RN MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR "STEAL" THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A "SOCIAL UPRISING" IN NICARAGUA AGAINST THE SYSTEM, AND THERE WILL BE "A HARSHER STRUGGLE THAN THAT OF PAST YEARS." "FRANKLIN" SAID THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED SOME 30,000 TROOPS TO DEPARTMENTS IN NORTHERN NICARAGUA TO "INTIMIDATE AND MURDER" UNO SYMPATHIZERS. HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE CONTRAS WILL NOT PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS, BECAUSE THE CAUSE THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF THOSE FORCES -- THE SANDINISTS' ASCENT TO POWER -- "HAS NOT YET DISAPPEARED," AND "THE REPRESSION CONTINUES." HE ADDED THAT HIS FIGHTERS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THE CAMPS IN EASTERN HONDURAS IF THE HONDURAN GOVERNMENT REQUESTS THAT THEY DO SO, BUT THEIR FAMILIES WOULD REMAIN.

[TEXT] WITH JUST THREE DAYS TO GO BEFORE THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 12 NOVEMBER, TERRORISTS HAVE STEPPED UP THEIR VIOLENCE AND SECURITY FORCES HAVE INTENSIFIED THEIR ANTISUBVERSIVE OPERATIONS IN SEVERAL PERUVIAN REGIONS. SHINING PATH MEMBERS LAST NIGHT BOMBED AN OFFICE OF THE RULING AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE (APRA) PARTY IN LIMA, INJURING FOUR PEOPLE, ONE OF THEM SERIOUSLY. DURING THE ATTACK THE OFFICE WAS SET ON FIRE. AN EYEWITNESS SAID THAT SOME 150 ELECTORAL CARDS WERE BURNED. THE CARDS, WHICH ARE THE ONLY VALID DOCUMENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE ELECTIONS, HAD BEEN TAKEN TO THE PARTY OFFICE SO THAT THE VOTING STATION COULD BE DEFINED. POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED AT LEAST SIX BOMBINGS LAST NIGHT IN THE ANDEAN CITY OF AYACUCHO, 575 KM SOUTHEAST OF THE LIMA. THE SOURCES, HOWEVER, DID NOT MENTION THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE ATTACKED. ON 7 NOVEMBER, SHINING PATH TERRORISTS BLEW UP 4 PYLONS IN THE VICINITY OF AYACUCHO, RAZING TO 17 THE NUMBER OF PYLONS THAT HAVE BEEN BLOWN UP BY THIS MAOIST ORGANIZATION IN AYACUCHO AND IN ZONES OF HUANCAVELICA DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.

IN LA OROYA, JUNIN DEPARTMENT, IN THE CENTRAL PERUVIAN MOUNTAIN RANGE, PUBLIC BUILDINGS WERE BOMBED AND A CAR-BOMB WAS DETONATED. REPORTS RECEIVED FROM AYACUCHO AND FROM OTHER RURAL AREAS SAY THAT TERRORISTS ARE STOPPING VEHICLES IN HIGHWAYS AND THAT THEY ARE STRIPPING PASSENGERS OF THEIR ELECTORAL CARDS, WHICH THEY THEN DESTROY. IN VIEW OF THIS ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE, THE GOVERNMENT ON 7 NOVEMBER DECREED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE 10 PROVINCES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LIMA, PLACING THEM UNDER MILITARY CONTROL.

THE SAME MEASURE HAS ALREADY BEEN ENFORCED IN AYACUCHO, APURIMAC, AND HUANCAVELICA. THE POLITICAL-MILITARY COMMAND OF THE AYACUCHO EMERGENCY ZONE LAST NIGHT ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE ENFORCING STRICT MEASURES THAT WILL BE OBSERVED BY THE PEOPLE DURING THE ELECTIONS. THE COMMUNIQUE STATES THAT AS OF 13 NOVEMBER, THOSE ELECTORAL CARD THAT DO NOT BEAR THE SEAL THAT IS STAMPED AT THE VOTING STATIONS AND WHICH PROVES THAT THE BEARER HAS CAST HIS VOTE WILL BE ARRESTED AND "PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE COURTS."

[TEXT] ON HIS WAY HOME, PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA TODAY STOPPED OVER IN BOGOTA, WHERE HE MET WITH PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO AND VISITED EL ESPECTADOR NEWSPAPER OFFICES, WHICH WERE DYNAMITED BY DRUG TRAFFICKERS LAST WEEKEND.

AFTER MEETING WITH BARCO, GARCIA TOLD REPORTERS THAT A COMMISSION MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES OF DRUG-AFFECTED COUNTRIES--BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, PERU, AND THE UNITED STATES-- SHOULD BE FORMED BUT THAT EUROPE SHOULD ALSO PARTICIPATE. [BEGIN RECORDING] [GARCIA] IF A EUROPEAN REPRESENTATIVE IS ABSENT FROM THE TALKS ON DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ADDICTION, IT WILL BE AS IF ONE LEG OF THE TABLE IS MISSING. [END RECORDING] GARCIA ALSO VISITED LUIS CARLOS GALAN'S GRAVE AND EL ESPECTADOR'S DEBRIS AND EXPRESSED TO THE PAPER'S OWNERS HIS SYMPATHY FOR THEM BECAUSE OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS. OVER A CUP OF COLOMBIAN COFFEE, HE TALKED WITH THE JOURNALISTS ABOUT DRUG TRAFFICKING, SAYING: MY COUNTRY IS NOT AS BADLY THREATENED AS COLOMBIA BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE DRUG CARTELS IN PERU.

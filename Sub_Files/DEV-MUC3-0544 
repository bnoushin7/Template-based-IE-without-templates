[TEXT] GUATEMALAN SECURITY FORCES TODAY DECLARED A "GENERAL ALERT" AFTER A RADIO STATION IN THE CAPITAL RECEIVED A PHONE CALL IN WHICH AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON THREATENED A GENERALIZED ATTACK ON RADIO STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. ODILIO DELEON, 42, AN ANNOUNCER FOR RADIO CULTURAL, TOLD THE POLICE THAT HE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL YESTERDAY IN WHICH AN ATTACK ON RADIO STATIONS WAS THREATENED. NO REASON FOR THE THREAT WAS GIVEN. POLICE SOURCES SAID THAT IN VIEW OF THIS REPORT, SECURITY FORCES WERE ALERTED AND INVESTIGATIONS BEGUN TO IDENTIFY THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PLAN. OVER 20 MONTHS AGO, THE OPERATOR OF A TRANMISSION TOWER FOR CHANNEL 7 TELEVISION WAS KILLED BY A HIGH-POWERED BOMB DETONATED BY UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS. THE HOME OF ROLANDO ARCHILA, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF GUATEMALA'S EMISORAS UNIDAS, THE RADIO STATION WITH THE LARGEST AUDIENCE IN THE COUNTRY, WAS DAMAGED IN A TERRORIST ATTACK. THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT ATTRIBUTED THESE ACTIONS TO "EXTREME RIGHTIST" GROUPS SEEKING TO "DESTABILIZE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS INITIATED IN JANUARY, 1986," AFTER 2 DECADES OF MILITARY REGIMES. SO FAR, IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE THREAT TO THE RADIO STATIONS WAS MADE BY THOSE GROUPS, OR IF IT CAME FROM THE EXTREME LEFT (THE GUERRILLAS).

[TEXT] COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MINISTER CARLOS LEMOS HAS HINTED THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE MARXIST GUERRILLA GROUP ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION [ELN] WHO HAVE MURDERED THE 77 FOLLOWERS OF THE LEFT-WING PARTY THE PATRIOTIC UNION [UP]. LEMOS SAID: I CAN EXPECT ANYTHING FROM THE ELN. HE ADDED THAT HE BELIEVED THAT THIS GROUP MAKES NO EXCEPTIONS WHEN IT WANTS TO KILL SOMEONE. THE UP HAS BLAMED PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY FOR THE ANNIHILATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST ITS MEMBERS, DEMANDING GUARANTEES FOR THEIR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES WITH LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS TAKE PLACE. THE UP MADE THE REPORT FOLLOWING THE MURDER ON 26 FEBRUARY OF APARTADO MAYOR DIANA CORDOBA SALDARRIAGA -- APARTADO IS LOCATED 480 KM TO THE NORTHEAST OF BOGOTA -- AND THE MURDER ON THE EVENING OF 27 FEBRUARY OF SIX MORE UP FOLLOWERS IN UNGUIA, A VILLAGE IN CHOCO DEPARTMENT. WHEN BLAMING THE ELN, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER SAID THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WANT TO BRING ANARCHY AND INSTABILITY TO THE COUNTRY. LEMOS ADDED THAT AS PART OF THE ELN'S DESTABLIZATION CAMPAIGN, IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE MURDER PEOPLE OF OTHER LEFT-WING SECTORS AS THEIR GOAL, AND ADMITTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF THREATS AGAINST VARIOUS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INCLUDING HIMSELF. WHEN REFERRING TO THE UP'S REPORTS HOLDING THE MILITARY RESPONSIBLE, HE SAID THAT THIS WAS ABSURD AND ADDED THAT IT IS INTENDED TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATIONS ASTRAY AND TO TRY TO STOP THE ELECTIONS IN COLOMBIA.

[TEXT] U.S. AMBASSADOR TO COLOMBIA THOMAS MCNAMARA HAS BEEN DECLARED A PRIORITY "MILITARY TARGET" OF THE MARXIST ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION (ELN) GUERRILLA GROUP, THE ELN ANNOUNCED TODAY IN A COMMUNIQUE SENT TO EFE IN BOGOTA. THE COMMUNIQUE WAS DELIVERED IN THE MIDST OF AN ELN OFFENSIVE THAT HAS LASTED FOR OVER THREE WEEKS. IT HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY KIDNAPPINGS, ATTACKS ON TOWNS, MOBILE ROADBLOCKS ON THE MAIN HIGHWAYS, AND AMBUSHES SET FOR MILITARY AND POLICE PERSONNEL. ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLA GROUP, THE PURPOSE OF THE ATTACK IS TO PROTEST U.S. INTERVENTION IN COLOMBIA, TO SABOTAGE THE MUNICIPAL AND LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 11 MARCH, AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ON 27 MAY, AND TO DENOUNCE THE "DIRTY WAR." IN TODAY'S MESSAGE THE ELN LISTS "AMBASSADOR THOMAS MCNAMARA" AS A "PRIORITY" MILITARY OBJECTIVE AT THE TOP OF THEIR LIST. IT ADDED THAT OTHER TARGETS ARE "U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS," "U.S. CITIZENS WHO HEAD THE MULTINATIONAL TEXAS AND OCCIDENTAL OIL COMPANIES," AND "ALL AMERICANS WHO INTERVENE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN OUR NATION'S INTERNAL CONFLICT." THIS PRO-CASTRO GUERRILLA GROUP IS HOLDING U.S. CITIZENS DAVID LESLIE KENT AND JAMES ARTHUR DONELLY, WHO WERE KIDNAPPED IN MEDELLIN ON 12 AND 13 FEBRUARY, TO PROTEST U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S VISIT TO THIS COUNTRY.

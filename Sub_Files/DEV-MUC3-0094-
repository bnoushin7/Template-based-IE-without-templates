[TEXT] A BOMB EXPLODED TODAY IN A LIMA RESTAURANT, AND A SECOND DEVICE THAT HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE SAME ESTABLISHMENT WAS DEACTIVATED BY THE PERUVIAN NATIONAL POLICE. THERE WERE NO VICTIMS, AND THE EXPLOSION CAUSED VERY LITTLE DAMAGE TO THE RESTAURANT, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE COMMERCIAL ARE OF THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT OF MIRAFLORES. GUERRILLAS OF THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MRTA) HAVE CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE TERRORIST ACT THROUGH PAMPHLETS THEY LEFT ON THE PREMISES, ACCORDING TO THE POLICE.

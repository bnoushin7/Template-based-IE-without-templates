Last night, Adly Mansour, the interim leader of Egypt, announced plans to 
reform Egypt's constitution and hold a new round of parliamentary and 
presidential elections. The interim president also announced a judicial 
investigation into yesterday's shooting of at least 51 supporters of deposed 
president Mohamed Morsi. 

Mansour plans to form a panel within fifteen days to review and suggest changes
to the now-suspended constitution. Those amendments would be voted on in a 
referendum within four months. Parliamentary elections would then be held, 
perhaps in early 2014, followed by presidential elections upon the forming 
of a new parliament.""
